# Interactive Coffee Sales Dashboard (Excel)

This project is an **end-to-end Microsoft Excel solution** for analyzing coffee sales data, transforming raw information into a dynamic and interactive dashboard.

## What I've Done in This Project:

* **Data Integration:** Consolidated sales data from 'Orders', 'Customers', and 'Products' tables.
* **Advanced Data Transformation:**
    * Performed lookups for customer details (name, email, country) and product information (coffee type, roast type, size, unit price).
    * Calculated 'Total Sales' and created user-friendly names for coffee and roast types.
    * Applied custom formatting for dates, sizes, and currency, handling blank values for cleaner data.
* **Structured Data Management:** Converted the raw data into an **Excel Table** for efficient data updates.
* **Dynamic Dashboard Creation:** Designed an interactive dashboard with:
    * Line chart for sales over time (by coffee type).
    * Bar charts for sales by country and top 5 customers.
* **Interactive Controls:** Implemented **slicers** (Roast Type, Size, Loyalty Card) and a **timeline** (Order Date) for dynamic data filtering.
* **Dashboard Aesthetics:** Customized chart designs and control styling for a professional and intuitive user experience.
